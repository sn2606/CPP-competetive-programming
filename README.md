<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Repository

Data Structures and Algorithms is a challenging and interesting subject. I love problem solving and do it regularly. This is a code-dump repository which has all codes of problems I have solved since February, 2021.


### Websites

* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
* [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the CPP-JAVA-DSA
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sn2606/CPP-JAVA-DSA.git
   ```
2. Browse through the folders!
3. The repo is updated regularly, so make sure to pull the code
   ```sh
   git pull
   ```


### Organization

* The problems are divided according to major topics they are from
* Problem statements are commented out at the top of the code
* LeetCode problems are named leetcode_(problem no)_(problem title) and only the Solution class is provided
* Other problems are named just by their title
* Standard algorithms are implemented in Java and are in the Algorithms folder
* Data Structures are implemented in C and can be found in their respective folders
